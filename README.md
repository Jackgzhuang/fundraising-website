# Event Fundraising
An event fundraising website where individuals can create personal pages, set goals and raise money for the overall goal.

## Contributing
If you happen to be a charity or non-profit event that has a fundraising component, and would like to use this platform for your event, the author can help you get set up. This will also help development by making the product more easily adaptable to events.

If you are a Django/Python or CSS developer, we have a healthy list of features we would like to implement in the [TODO](TODO) file. I may move that to a ticket tracker if a few people join. The author will approve pull requests for the time being. I am also looking for designer help to clean up the design and make a better "thermometer".
