Usability test March 17, Iphone SE

Tasks 1: Donate to Peter Sagan
- Scrolled instead of searching
- Didn't put in name when trying to be anonymous - just skipped it
- didn't return to merchant, assumed it was fine

Task 2: Sign up to be a fundraiser
- couldn't find Join - or sure what it means
- "should have first and last name when joining"
- allowed low security password, but didn't work
- "provide info about low password security"
- "provide feedback that the passwords are / are not the same"
- "more spacing at bottom below buttons"

Task 3: Log out
- Logout / return still shows logged in

Task 4: Recover password
- change password goes to blank screen on iphone - connection broken at the time?

Thoughts:
- "provide feedback that your password isn't the same"
- "provide feedback that your password is not good enough"
